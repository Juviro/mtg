OPTIONAL IN MIGRATION BRANCH:
    - re-enable deck card selection for mobile
    - display eur prices in collection value + graphs
    - display how many cards are included in eur/usd price (collection)

IMPROVEMENTS:
    - redesign moveTo modal, especially for mobile
    - mobile card list preview: allow swipe to next card
    - move to new image service
    - deck: check for illegal dupliactions

    - add deck colors to deck overview list
    - improve re-rendering of table columns and grid card. especially table.
    - added to collection notification -> show amount as well
    - add optimistic response to card delete in deck (esp. mobile)

FEATURES:
    - show last search when no input in searchbar
    - check for multiple copies of one card for deck legality check
    - show if deck is legal in deck overview, order by legality (similar to magic arena)

REFACTORINGS:
    - Split more code with React.lazy
    - use AuthenticationError in authenticateUser, don't redirect in frontend
    - evaluate removing some caching, using network-only more
    - drop table events
    * add field to cards table: version number (1 or 2 in most cases) for:
        * Not having to calc it again in oracleCard -> allSets
        * When adding a card to collection/deck avoid version numbers other than 1. I think that means preferring version 1 for distinctCards
