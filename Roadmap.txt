 BUGFIXES:
    - backend deployment not reloading
    - table header too short (?)
    - collection: when one price is null, 0 is displayed even if one owned card has a value
    - add to collection mobile: after adding prev unowned card (gitrok monster), wrong minPrice in wantsList
    - snapshot can be null, throws error because not nullable in schema
    - clicking on grid card in desktop not opening modal if already selected
    - hide *show charts' when collection not loaded OR ignore snapshot if null

NEXT:

IMPROVEMENTS: 
    - improve grid card info box design for desktop
    - add range picker to collection to only show cards added in specific timeframe (1h, 24h, 7d, 3m, 1y)

FEATURES:
    - card search
    - add edhrec and scryfall to card links
    - in search field: *foil* suffix should add as foil

REFACTORINGS:

BACKLOG:
    - when adding cards, allow picking set/version, with preview
    - add error page
    - when adding to deck or linked wants: show if card is in linked wants / deck
    - Add option to deck to fill up empty card slots with basic lands, based on mana occurrance
    - find a way to make collection value work
    - sharable collection / decks / wants
    - prevent user from adding amount / amount foil if card is not available in foil / non-foil
    - prefer owned versions when adding to deck or wants
    - suggest similar cards when having invalid cardname in multiinput
