        - mkm prices via their api (min, avg)
        - related cards (token, partner, meld etc - should be in db? or skryfall?)

REFACTORINGS:
 
BACKLOG:
    - refresh google access ?
    - when opening login, redirect to / if user is logged in
    - delete session when logging out
    - allow sort by mana cost to collection
    - on mobile: advanced search -> click card -> search card throught searchBar -> click back: show show advanced search without card modal. Maybe use replace history.
    - add possible combos section to detail card view (https://discordapp.com/channels/673601282946236417/673601283609067559, no api yet)
    - only show distinct cards on search, but in a way that the set still works. DistinctCardsPerSets view?
    - add expandable (lazy load) edhrec synergies to card view
    - add info tooltip for search: explain amount prefix, fuzzy search
    - allow searching for multiple sets/types/subtypes?
    - when adding cards, allow picking set/version, with preview
    - add error page
    - clickable creature type in card details?
    - home page: quick stats for collection, quick access for last edited decks + wants
    - show % owned of all cards (unique cards / distinct cards)
    - in search field: *foil* suffix should add as foil
    - when adding to deck or linked wants: show if card is in linked wants / deck
    - sharable collection / decks / wants
    - prevent user from adding amount / amount foil if card is not available in foil / non-foil
    - prefer owned versions when adding to deck or wants
    - suggest similar cards when having invalid cardname in multiinput
    - show all current search options for advanced search (M/D)

BACKLOG BUGFIXES:
    - if only foil owned, show foil price as min price
    - backend deployment not reloading
    - collection: when one price is null, 0 is displayed even if one owned card has a value
    - add to collection mobile: after adding prev unowned card (gitrok monster), wrong minPrice in wantsList
    - add to collection -> remove -> re-add -> edit: amount is 0
