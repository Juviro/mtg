BUGFIXES:
    - can't put duplicate card in deck

CURRENT:
    - only show distinct cards on search, but in a way that the set still works. DistinctCardsPerSets view?

NEXT:
    - simple search + card details
        - remove decks and wants lists from search bar
        - rename *advanced search* to *show all*
        - increase # of displayed results

IMPROVEMENTS: 
    - ignore // in cards search. "Dusk dawn" should find dusk // dawn

FEATURES:
    - detail card view - like current desktop modal plus:
        - oracle text
        - mkm prices via their api (min, avg)
        - add edhrec and scryfall to card links
        - related cards (token, partner, meld etc - should be in db? or skryfall?)

REFACTORINGS:
 
BACKLOG:

    - refresh google access ?
    - swipe card preview on mobile
    - show *add commander* in deck list when no commander selected

    - in search field: *foil* suffix should add as foil
    - when adding to deck or linked wants: show if card is in linked wants / deck
    - sharable collection / decks / wants
    - prevent user from adding amount / amount foil if card is not available in foil / non-foil
    - prefer owned versions when adding to deck or wants
    - suggest similar cards when having invalid cardname in multiinput
    - show all current search options for advanced search (M/D)

BACKLOG BUGFIXES:
    - backend deployment not reloading
    - collection: when one price is null, 0 is displayed even if one owned card has a value
    - add to collection mobile: after adding prev unowned card (gitrok monster), wrong minPrice in wantsList
    - add to collection -> remove -> re-add -> edit: amount is 0
