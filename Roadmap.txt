BUGFIXES:
    - a lot of the cards are white on render, display only on scroll (mobile, guess this is fixed in migration)
    - Share button visible for non-owned wants lists
    - no error boundary for card search desktop (https://mythic-commander.com/cards/XXX)
    - collection -> sort by price -> last page: reloading changes order of elements
    - lifetracker: stuck in loading screen when bg images disabled
    - re-write getColorFromId now that ids are strings
    - on high latency network: move card from deck wants to deck -> wrong cards displayed in deck wants
    - auto update cards on prod not working
    - select cards -> copy to some deck -> selection should be cleared, but isn't
    - hover over DeckCardsnotCollected label with a lot of cards: layout shifts because new scrollbar is added


OPTIONAL IN MIGRATION BRANCH:
    - click search -> scroll to list start, similar to mobile (add for mobile as well, if it's autosearch)
    - display eur prices in card detail view
    - display eur prices in collection value + graphs
    - display how many cards are included in eur/usd price
    - when no eur price available: estimate based on avg price diff (calc in psql once) (?)
    - redesign moveTo modal, especially for mobile

    - advanced search -> add card to collection: owned badge not displayed
