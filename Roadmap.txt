BUGFIXES:
    - demigod listed under god
    - deploying crashes (gone?)
    - adding a new deck AND deleting a deck will not add it to the decks list
    - Deck image select has no default value
    - wants list: sort for last added seems to be broken
    - totalAmount in deck/wants list is not displaying recent changes
    - totalAmount in deck/wants list is not counting the amount
    - when searching for card in add deck etc, name is not highlighted when using amount
    - wants list -> total cost in not taking the amount into account

NEXT:
    - allow adding wants list in card view
    - when adding cards to wants list, show message.success
    - add option to export unowned deck cards to list (maybe desktop only?)

WANTS
    - duplicate wants list
    - When editing, allow editing of amount as well

IMPROVEMENTS: 
    - increase search bar dropdown height
    - add filter options:
        - rarity
        - cmc (range?)
        - power (range?)
        - owned (not collection)
    - evaluate adding oracle text search for collection, monitor response size
    - show number of results on top as well
    - on deck/wants/collection add, show *already contained* badge like the owned badge in searchbar

FEATURES: 
    - on card overview, show which decks include that card
    - add *owned* filter to advanced search
    - Make sets clickable in card view, jump to filtered cards view

REFACTORINGS:
    - Add db constraint, if amount + amountFoil = 0 => delete row
    - add message bold helper
