PRIORITY BUGFIXES
    - auto update cards on prod not working

BUGFIXES:
    - a lot of the cards are white on render, display only on scroll (mobile, guess this is fixed in migration)
    - no error boundary for card search desktop (https://mythic-commander.com/cards/XXX)
    - lifetracker: stuck in loading screen when bg images disabled
    - re-write getColorFromId now that ids are strings
    - select cards -> copy to some deck -> selection should be cleared, but isn't
    - hover over DeckCardsnotCollected label with a lot of cards: layout shifts because new scrollbar is added

NEXT:
    * Deck Sublist number of cards not counting duplicates (e.g. lands)
    * Decks sharable

OPTIONAL IN MIGRATION BRANCH:
    - re-enable deck card selection
    - display eur prices in collection value + graphs
    - display how many cards are included in eur/usd price

CURRENT:
    - mobile card list preview: allow swpie to next card

NEXT:
    - redesign moveTo modal, especially for mobile
    - Split more code with React.lazy
    - move to new image service
    - deck: check for illegal dupliactions

    - add option to export unowned cards from deck to wants
    - allow sorting by added in advanced search
    - add deck colors to deck overview list

IMPROVEMENTS:
    - improve re-rendering of table columns and grid card. especially table.
    - add to wants list dropdown: sort lists by name (same for decks I guess)
    - added to collection notification -> show amount as well
    - add optimistic response to card delete in deck (esp. mobile)
    - remove basic lands from proxy queries (or add as option -> proxy rework)
    - autofocus for deck sidebar input field
    - transition for inset shadow when focussing deck sidebar

FEATURES:
    - sharable decks / wants
    - show last search when no input in searchbar
    - check for multiple copies of one card for deck legality check
    - show if deck is legal in deck overview, order by legality (similar to magic arena)

REFACTORINGS:
    - use AuthenticationError in authenticateUser, don't redirect in frontend
    - evaluate removing some caching, using network-only more
    - drop table events

    - backend deployment not reloading
    - when editing in card details, versions of same set are changing
    - advanced search -> add card to collection: owned badge not displayed
