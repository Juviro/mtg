 BUGFIXES:
    - backend deployment not reloading
    - collection total owned amount not updating when changing owned in details
    - table header too short
    - changeCollection returns minPrice for one card, not all cards

NEXT:
    - add option to move card: wants <-> deck
    - add warning that wants list will be cascaded when deck is deleted

IMPROVEMENTS: 
    - when adding to collection, update owned badge (deck, wants, collection ?) [MOBILE + DESKTOP]
    - one ESC, blur search and filter
    - improve grid card info box design for desktop
    - add 404 page
    - initially hide sidebar for small screens

FEATURES:

REFACTORINGS:
    - refactor collectionName, this should use oracle card to easily update owned
    - get rid of queries folder or clean it up
    - try to remove "network-only", replace with refetch queries
    - remove deck zone, add commander field to deck
    - basic lands modal on desktop too slow - mobile works

BACKLOG:
    - show current collection value in chart
    - Add option to deck to fill up empty card slots with basic lands, based on mana occurrance
    - find a way to make collection value work
    - sharable collection / decks / wants
    - prevent user from adding amount / amount foil if card is not available in foil / non-foil
    - prefer owned versions when adding to deck or wants
