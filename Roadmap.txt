 BUGFIXES:
    - backend deployment not reloading
    - table header too short (?)
    - mobile card detail add to collection: collection icons not displayed in select dropdown
    - add to collection mobile: after adding prev unowned card (gitrok monster), wrong minPrice in wantsList

NEXT:
    - when scrolling down collection, slow on tablet. evaluate re-adding react.memo, maybe without custom compare function
    - edit grid card in deck slow on table
    - move collection charts to info:
        - total cards: 8001   [arrow-up] + 12% (tooltip: last 7 days development - click for more) 
        - on click: show popover with chart or modal with all charts
    - card search

IMPROVEMENTS: 
    - improve grid card info box design for desktop
    - when pressing esc while editing in desktop modal, don't close modal, just cancel editing
    - when adding to deck or linked wants: show if card is in linked wants / deck

FEATURES:
    - add edhrec and scryfall to card links
