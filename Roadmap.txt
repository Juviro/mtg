BUGFIXES:
    - highlighting of cardnames flawed
    - a lot of the cards are white on render, display only on scroll
    - ancient den listed as artifact instead of land in deck

    - "Hidd stri" search crashes client?

CURRENT:
    - on high latency network: move card from deck wants to deck -> wrong cards displayed in deck wants

NEXT:
    - re-add loading animation to paginated list (e.g. collection desktop)
    - refactor authentication, remove from context creation
    - improve loading time of deck
    - add stylelint
    - when only displaying unowned in deck -> add cards to.. -> pre-select unowned only, but show all
    - prevent re-ordering card lists in decks view - maybe re-order when category added / removed
    - add shortcut to toggle focus ?

    - add button to add card to deck in sidebar ?
    - add option to export unowned cards from deck to wants
    - allow sorting by added in advanced search

IMPROVEMENTS:
    - improve re-rendering of table columns and grid card. especially table.
    - add to wants list dropdown: sort lists by name (same for decks I guess)
    - added to collection notification -> show amount as well
    - add optimistic response to card delete in deck (esp. mobile)
    - show which cards are not legal in deck
    - remove basic lands from proxy queries
    - autofocus for deck sidebar input field
    - transition for inset shadow when focussing deck sidebar

FEATURES:
    - sharable decks / wants
    - add support for planeswalker commanders
    - show last search when no input in searchbar
    - show if deck is legal in deck overview, order by legality (similar to magic arena)

REFACTORINGS:
    - use AuthenticationError in authenticateUser, don't redirect in frontend
    - evaluate removing some caching, using network-only more
    - drop table events
 
BACKLOG:
    - allow sort by type (ramp, card draw, ...)
    - remove sidebar from collection and wants list, add to header, similar to mobile
    - add proxy to menu, allow to add single cards
    - when adding basics to deck, default to full art
    - remove all cards < 0.2$ from collection value , rename value to estimation
    - add enchantment types (e.g. shrine) to creature types in advanced search, rename to subtype or similar

    - allow multiple selected elements in grid list with shift
    - allow search for unowned cards only
    - refresh google access ?
    - better tooltips for multi input icon
    - swipe card preview on mobile
    - going back to list should preserve scroll position (desktop)
    - shortcuts should use modifier key ?
    - advanced adding:
        - display all versions from a card + their setname, maybe with preview
    - when opening login, redirect to / if user is logged in
    - add to advanced search: number of owned copies
    - allow searching for multiple sets/types/subtypes?
    - add error page (should be already started, search for branch)

        - quick access for last edited decks + wants ?
    - show % owned of all cards (unique cards / distinct cards)
    - prevent user from adding amount / amount foil if card is not available in foil / non-foil
    - prefer owned versions when adding to deck or wants
    - suggest similar cards when having invalid cardname in multiinput
    - dark mode
    - update document title based on content
    - allow text export/proxy of selected cards
    - rework advanced search:
        - add *unownedOnly*
        - show all current search options for advanced search 
    - use first card / 4-split card as wants list image


BACKLOG BUGFIXES:
    - sometimes rules of previously viewed cards displayed instead of current card
    - don't ignore umlaute in search (backend and frontend) e.g. JÃ¶tun Grunt

    - backend deployment not reloading
    - when editing in card details, versions of same set are changing
    - advanced search -> add card to collection: owned badge not displayed
    - collection: when one price is null, 0 is displayed even if one owned card has a value
    - add to collection mobile: after adding prev unowned card (gitrok monster), wrong minPrice in wantsList
    - mobile: collection -> card details view -> remove from collection -> back to collection: card not deleted
    - when sorting by price high to low, cards are displayed with min price instead of max price
