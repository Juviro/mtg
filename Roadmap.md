## FEATURES:

- show last search when no input in searchbar

- allow editing the name of wants in deck sidebar
- allow multi drag & drop when multiple cards selected

## REFACTORINGS:

- Split more code with React.lazy
- evaluate removing some caching, using network-only more
- add field to cards table: version number (1 or 2 in most cases) for:
  - Not having to calc it again in oracleCard -> allSets
  - When adding a card to collection/deck avoid version numbers other than 1. I think that means prefering version 1 for distinctCards

## BACKLOG:

- select cards -> copy to some deck -> selection should be cleared, but isn't
- when adding basics to deck, default to full art that have an mkm price

- refresh google access ?
- better tooltips for multi input icon
- swipe card preview on mobile
- going back to list should preserve scroll position (desktop)
- advanced adding:
  - display all versions from a card + their setname, maybe with preview
- when opening login, redirect to "/" if user is logged in
- add to advanced search: number of owned copies
- add error page (should be already started, search for branch)
- clickable creature type in card details?
- home page:
  - quick stats for collection
  - quick access for last edited decks + wants ?
- show % owned of all cards (unique cards / distinct cards)
- prevent user from adding amount / amount foil if card is not available in foil / non-foil
- prefer owned versions when adding to deck or wants
- dark mode
- allow text export of selected cards
- rework advanced search:
  - show all current search options for advanced search
- check for multiple copies of one card for deck legality check

## BACKLOG BUGFIXES:

- sometimes rules of previously viewed cards displayed instead of current card
- Deck dropzone is small if only commanders are in the deck
- advanced search -> add card to collection: owned badge not displayed
- collection: when one price is null, 0 is displayed even if one owned card has a value
- add to collection mobile: after adding prev unowned card (gitrok monster), wrong minPrice in wantsList
- mobile: collection -> card details view -> remove from collection -> back to collection: card not deleted
- when sorting by price high to low, cards are displayed with min price instead of max price
