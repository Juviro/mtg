IMPROVEMENTS: 


FEATURES:
    * Wants list (text export, proxie printer)
    * on card overview, show which decks include that card
    * add set view: display all cards from a set, allow search/filter. Maybe just add this as a filter to *all cards* view

REFACTORINGS:

    * Add Skeleton component that wraps around other components ?
    * Check query fetching (re-rendering) in search bar
    * evaluate moving collection to provider, just updating it - CURRENTLY NOT NECESSARY (collection is unused) - is it?

---

* Don't show app skeleton when user is not authenticated yet?
* add support for multiple commanders to commander color identity etc (low prio)
