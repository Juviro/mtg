## BACKLOG:

when opening login, redirect to "/" if user is logged in
add to advanced search: number of owned copies
clickable creature type in card details?

## BACKLOG BUGFIXES:

collection: when one price is null, 0 is displayed even if one owned card has a value
add to collection mobile: after adding prev unowned card (gitrok monster), wrong minPrice in wantsList
mobile: collection -> card details view -> remove from collection -> back to collection: card not deleted
when sorting by price high to low, cards are displayed with min price instead of max price
open prod myc in browser -> deploy new version -> click on any page in myc => crash because chunks got new hash
